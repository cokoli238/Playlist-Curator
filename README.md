# Playlist-Curator

### Statement
OPL Final Project by Ethan Cumming and Christian Okoli. We will utilize the spotify api to create a playlist from a .csv file

### Analysis
The project will utilize the concepts of data abstraction, object orientation, and recursion. The data abstraction is primarily in how we will import our data from a .csv file and transform the data into an acceptable type for the Spotify Web API to understand. Additionally, if we are to access a user account from Spotify will need OAuth library, which uses abstracted for security purposes. Furthermore, object orientation will be used with the web-server package which can create an HTTP client based on user input. Finally, recursion will be used to parse and feed individual track data to the Spotify API and into the playlist.

### External Technologies 
Spotify Web API - To communicate with the Spotify Web App which will build the playlist

OAuth â€“ Authorization protocol to access user information

### Data Sets or other Source Materials
Data from a music library will be imported from a .csv file. This data can be acquired by selecting the music from your preferred music manager and copying it into an excel spreadsheet. From there export the spreadsheet as a .csv file.

### Deliverable and Demonstration
The end product will have the user upload a file and enter their Spotify credentials. Moreover, a playlist will be created and the data will be parsed to add all the songs into the playlist. When the process is complete, the user will be presented with a webpage of the playlist. 

### Evaluation of Results
The project will be successful if the curated playlist contains the whole of the imported data and if the procedure is accomplished relatively quickly (less than 5 minutes). Additionally, another barometer for success is the ease in which the user accomplishes their task.  

## Architecture Diagram
Upload the architecture diagram you made for your slide presentation to your repository, and include it in-line here.

Create several paragraphs of narrative to explain the pieces and how they interoperate.

## Schedule
### First Milestone (Sun Apr 9)
HTTP client setup. Functionality inlcudes uploading/importing the .csv file and user input formated correctly for the client.

### Second Milestone (Sun Apr 16)
HTTP client communicates with Spotify API. Functionality includes generating a playlist and sending parsed data to add to the playlist.

### Public Presentation (Mon Apr 24, Wed Apr 26, or Fri Apr 28 [your date to be determined later])
A browser opening the link to the playlist sent by the Spotify. A feature that will be necessary for the presentation.

## Group Responsibilities
Here each group member gets a section where they, as an individual, detail what they are responsible for in this project. Each group member writes their own Responsibility section. Include the milestones and final deliverable.

Please use Github properly: each individual must make the edits to this file representing their own section of work.

**Additional instructions for teams of three:** 
* Remember that you must have prior written permission to work in groups of three (specifically, an approved `FP3` team declaration submission).
* The team must nominate a lead. This person is primarily responsible for code integration. This work may be shared, but the team lead has default responsibility.
* The team lead has full partner implementation responsibilities also.
* Identify who is team lead.

In the headings below, replace the silly names and GitHub handles with your actual ones.
